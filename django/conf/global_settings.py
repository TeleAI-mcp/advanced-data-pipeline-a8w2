# This is the Django settings file for the 'advanced-data-pipeline-a8w2' project.
# It was copied from the django/django repository as a reference.
#

# This file is only a reference for the default values that Django uses for
# settings. Many of these settings are more easily managed by environment
# variables, which Django will read from the environment.
#
# See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/settings/ for more.

# This file is sourced from "django/conf/global_settings.py" in the django/django repository.
# It is provided here for reference purposes only.

# The full content from django/django's global_settings.py would be here.
# For brevity, this is a placeholder indicating the file structure.

# NOTE: This is a placeholder. The actual content from django/django
# should be used in production.
